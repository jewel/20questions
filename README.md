Play 20 Questions against ChatGPT
===

ChatGPT will happily play 20 questions against you, but because it has no
hidden state it will modify its answer to best fit your questions.  This
command-line program uses the ChatGPT API to create a more realistic game.

You will need your own API keys to play.
